Code for producing schedules from the schedule spreadsheet. Workflow is: comment/uncomment stuff in index.js to display either the master schedule or the participant schedules -> open index.html locally -> print it.

The schedule spreadsheet needs to be tweaked to make this work - notably, there needs to be a row added at the top.  Ask Steph if you want to know how to do it.
